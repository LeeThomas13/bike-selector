          Bike-Selector by Cheerios Group Inc. was founded in Summer 2020, after
          a collaborative meeting took place between cyclists and bike-riding
          enthusiast's. We observed that the local market wasn't appealing to
          our sport and we decided to give our community a resource that could
          provide people with the tools and support that they need.

            <h2>Taylor Johnson</h2>
            <p>I am a problem solver with a knack for technology. Before I entered the world of Software Development I was a Manufacturing Engineer. I loved setting up new machines and learning their software. Designing tools to produce the perfect part while still meeting the constraints of the machine was very satisfying. I realized my favorite part of the job was learning new problem solving technologies. When it became clear I was ready for a career change, software development stood out as the ultimate problem solving technology. I started teaching myself web development and was immediately hooked. I found my way into a boot camp and which pushed my capacity for learning even farther. The more I learn the more it solidifies  that Software Development is exactly where I want to be.</p>

            <h2>Lee Thomas</h2>
            <p>Hey I'm Lee and I am a front-end software developer at Code Fellows. I was a college student working odd jobs before I found Code Fellows. I chose this line of work because I have always been curious about every aspect of technology. I build computers as a hobby, so learning how to talk to them seemed like the perfect next step. I would love to work for a major gaming company, but I would be happy anywhere that allows me to be creative, and problem solve. Thanks to my extensive sports background I know how to be a leader, and a hard working teammate. I am also well acquainted with deadlines, and work tirelessly to meet them.</p>

            <h2>Spencer Lazzar</h2>
            <p>Hello, I am Spencer and I am a web developer. Before this I was helping run a family business in the automotive industry. Running this business gave me great experience working with a team and leading others. After much thought, it was time to take a new direction in life. I have always enjoyed technology and building things, so web development seemed like the perfect marriage between those two. I enjoy the process of learning and growing my knowledge of languages, libraries, and frameworks.</p>

            <h2>Rolando Haynes</h2>
            <p>HELLO ANAHIEM!
              My name is Rolando Morlan Haynes dela Vega. Ive been in the telecommunications industry for 20+ years. AND IM HERE TO CLEARLY COMMUNICATE WITH YOU! All caps. You're here and plausibly in front of me with an issue and I am willing to assist. But we donâ€™t always know the problem until its out in the air. This is my talent, having hard conversations. So we can get the the work of production and linking; people to product or people to people. All of this being said I recognize my military background may be of assistance in that I am solution driven and team oriented. To further, I have no feelings toward being in the front or the back, so long as the task at hand is accomplished to the best of the teams ability and meets deadlines.</p>

            <h2>Dominique Augurson</h2>
            <p>Before code fellows, I was working in the private security sector with my experience in the military and corrections.
              My education was tailored for civil service but I wanted to migrate into the IT field. 
              I think that most ideal environment would be with a remotely-connected position at a steady company.</p>

          Bike-Selector by Cheerios Group Inc. was founded in Summer 2020, after
          a collaborative meeting took place between cyclists and bike-riding
          enthusiast's. We observed that the local market wasn't appealing to
          our sport and we decided to give our community a resource that could
          provide people with the tools and support that they need.

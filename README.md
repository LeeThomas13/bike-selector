## Version Log

### 1.0.0
Project start. Basic layout and file organziation. Creation of repo and branch structure. 

Your project should be documented on GitHub and within your code base.

On GitHub, create a README.md file as the main landing document of your repository. Continue to update it as your project evolves.

At a minimum, your README.md should include the following:

The name of the project
Names of the team members
A description of the project
The overall problem domain and how the project solves those problems
Semantic versioning, beginning with version 1.0.0 and incremented as changes are made
A list of any libraries, frameworks, or packages that your application requires in order to properly function. If needed, provide instructions that the user may need to follow in order to get your application up and running on their own computer.
Within your code, document with meaningful comments. For example, a comment might provide an overview of what the function beneath it is doing, or describe the relationship between two variables.

Comments should be updated as necessary. Remove all unused, commented-out code before committing to GitHub.

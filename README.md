## Description

An interactive web app designed to help individuals interested in cycling figure out what type of bike is the right fit for their intended use.

## Solution

Our app will provide users with a tiered interactive menu that will reducibly lead them to the correct bicycle for their riding intentions.
It will ask first for their intended terrain (road, mountain, park). Next it will refine that selection into sub-categories to land on the specialized bike configuration for their intended riding. The app will have a form for the user to input their height and inseam measurement. This information will be stored in local memory and run through script to produce the proper frame size for the user. The app will also have a drop down menu with a range of budgets to select from. Based on the combination of forms and selections, the final bike presentation page will display to the user what specific bike type is right for them, what size of frame and what kind of options to expect their budget.

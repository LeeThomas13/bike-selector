## Vision

To empower people interested in biking by guiding them to the appropriate bike for their intended riding. The problem our product solves is stopping new riders from buying the wrong bike for their riding, becoming discouraged and giving up on biking. Riding with the wrong bike is far more likely to lead to bike related injury. Biking is a healthy hobby, for the rider and the environment.
